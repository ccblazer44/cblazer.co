      I'm a professional full stack developer and software engineer from the SF Bay Area, specializing in data pipelines, ETL, business intelligence, and automation. 
      I love making sense of complex data, optimizing workflows, and building scalable systems that reduce manual effort.
    </p>

    <p>
      I love the entire development lifecycle—building things, breaking them to test their limits, optimizing them for performance, and everything in between.  
      I'm weirdly passionate about naming conventions and standards like the 
      <TextLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO date format</TextLink>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of coding, I'm an avid <TextLink href="https://www.alltrails.com/members/chris-blazer-3">hiker,</TextLink>
      backpacker, snowboarder, and camper. More often than not, you'll find me <TextLink href="https://www.peakbagger.com/climber/climber.aspx?cid=49012">
      chasing summits</TextLink>
      —whether it's a weekend in the mountains or a multi-day backpacking trip. 
      Like most nerds, I also love <TextLink href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3338371-c-blaze">reading,</TextLink> mostly fantasy and sci-fi.
