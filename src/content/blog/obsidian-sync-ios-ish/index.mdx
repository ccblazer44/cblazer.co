I love Obsidian for my personal notes. I may go deeper into why and my personal setup in another post. However, the cost for Obsidian Sync is steep, and it comes with some limitations (like only supporting one vault). So, I set up my own sync using **iSH**, and you can too.

This guide assumes you already have a **GitHub repository** with your Obsidian vault in it. If you donâ€™t, first set one up. You can also check out the [Obsidian Git plugin](https://publish.obsidian.md/git-doc/Start+here) for syncing between computers.

Syncing to iOS is trickier. Many guides recommend using **Working Copy**, but it requires a paid upgrade ([Megan Sullivanâ€™s guide](https://meganesulli.com/blog/sync-obsidian-vault-iphone-ipad/) explains how). Using iSH takes a bit more tech know-how, but it's **completely free**.

## Step 0: Install iSH
Download [iSH Shell](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ish-shell/id1436902243) from the App Store.

---

## Step 1: Install and Configure Git for GitHub

Update Alpine:
```sh
apk update
```
Install Git:
```sh
apk add git
```
Install OpenSSH:
```sh
apk add openssh
```
Generate a new SSH key:
```sh
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "MY@EMAIL.COM"
```
Start the SSH agent:
```sh
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

### Configure SSH for GitHub
Edit SSH config:
```sh
vi ~/.ssh/config
```
config:
```sh
Host github.com
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```
Save and exit (`Esc`, then `:wq`).

Add your SSH private key to the SSH agent:
```sh
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```
Copy your public key and add it to [GitHub SSH settings](https://github.com/settings/ssh/new):
```sh
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```
Set your Git config:
```sh
git config --global user.email "YOUR@EMAIL.COM"
git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"
```
If you run into issues, check [this guide](https://github.com/januszoles/ish/blob/main/README.md#iphone6-github).

## Step 2: Setting Up Your Repo in Obsidian
Create an Obsidian directory:
```sh
mkdir obsidian
```
Move into it:
```sh
cd obsidian/
```
Mount the iOS file provider:
```sh
mount -t iOS . obsidian
```
This opens the iOS file selector. Select the **Obsidian** folder.

ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: If Obsidian doesnâ€™t recognize the vault after cloning, create a temporary vault in the app first, then delete it once your synced vault is working.

Now, clone your repo:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:username/repo.git
```
Your vault should now be visible in Obsidian!

---

## Step 3: Pushing and Pulling Changes
You can manually sync with Git commands, but I automated it with shell scripts.

Create push/pull scripts:
```sh
touch push.sh pull.sh
chmod +x push.sh pull.sh
```
Edit push.sh:
```sh
vi push.sh
```
push.sh:
```sh
cd ~/obsidian
git add --all
git commit -m "Commit from mobile"
git push
```
Edit pull.sh:
```sh
vi pull.sh
```
pull.sh:
```sh
cd ~/obsidian
git pull
```
For quicker access, create aliases:
```sh
vi .profile
```
.profile:
```sh
alias pull=~/pull.sh
alias push=~/push.sh
```
Reload the shell:
```sh
exit
```
Now, sync your vault using just `pull` and `push`!

Test it:
1. Edit your vault in Obsidian, then run `push` in iSH.
2. Edit your vault on another device, then run `pull` in iSH to sync.

## Conclusion
Syncing via iSH requires manually running `push` and `pull`, but for my use caseâ€”mainly accessing my **collection of recipes** on the goâ€”it works perfectly.
