## Back to the Web: Rediscovering Web Development After Years in Data

I’ve spent the past several years **deep in the world of data**—building ETL pipelines, automating business processes, wrangling SQL, and making dashboards tell better stories. It’s what I do best, and honestly, I love it.

But somewhere along the way, I lost touch with something I used to enjoy: **web development**.

I first dabbled in web dev back in school with **Django**, and later at work when I had to wrangle some **AngularJS** projects. But over time, my focus shifted entirely to **data engineering, automation, and business intelligence**—things like **SSIS, SSRS, Python scripting, and SQL performance tuning**.

And while I never really *needed* front-end skills in my day-to-day work, I started feeling that itch again—the urge to **build things from the ground up**.

## So Why This Site?

A few reasons:

1. **A Personal Playground** – I wanted my own little space on the internet to tinker, experiment, and showcase projects.
2. **A Place to Host My Work** – I’ve built a lot of cool things over the years, and it felt like time to start **documenting** them.
3. **A Low-Key Way to Level Up My Skills** – Rediscovering **modern web dev** felt like a challenge worth taking.
4. **(Let’s Be Real) It’s Also a Portfolio** – At the end of the day, this is also about **career growth**—but I don’t want it to scream “hire me” in a cringey way.

I didn’t just want a cookie-cutter portfolio. I wanted something that actually felt like **me**.

## Picking a Tech Stack

Since I hadn’t touched web dev in years, I had some catching up to do. React? Vue? Svelte? Serverless? Full-stack frameworks? Everything had changed since my AngularJS days.

But then I found **Astro**—and it just *clicked*.

Here’s why:

- **It’s built for speed** – No unnecessary JavaScript bloat, just fast static pages.
- **It’s flexible** – I could bring in **React, Svelte, Vue, or nothing at all**.
- **It feels like a mix of old and new** – Writing `.astro` files felt **natural**, kind of like writing Django templates but with modern capabilities.

I also loved the **“opt-in complexity”** mindset—start simple, and only add dynamic features *if* you need them. No SPA overhead, no unnecessary JavaScript. Just **lean, fast, and scalable**.

This was exactly what I needed for my site.

## Lessons (Re)Learned

Jumping back into web dev after years in data came with some fun realizations:

- **State management is still a headache.** React’s `useEffect()` struggles felt eerily similar to debugging ETL pipelines.
- **Naming things is still the hardest part.** Whether it’s tables, variables, or CSS classes—good names matter.
- **Performance optimization is a universal skill.** Query tuning in SQL and minimizing client-side JavaScript? Same brain, different playground.
- **Web frameworks have changed a lot—but good fundamentals stay the same.**

Building this site reminded me why I love **learning new things**. And honestly? It’s been fun.

## What’s Next?

I plan to use this site to document:

✔ **Projects I’ve built (both data and web-related)**

✔ **Things I’m experimenting with**

✔ **Random notes, thoughts, and maybe even some hiking trip reports**

So if you’ve made it this far—**thanks for reading!** If you’re building something new, or rediscovering an old skill, I’d love to hear about it.

Here’s to the next phase. 🚀
