## **Building My Personal Site: cblazer.co**

Every developer eventually reaches the point where they want a personal space on the web‚Äîsomewhere to showcase their projects, write about things they find interesting, and just have a digital home that reflects who they are. For me, **cblazer.co** is exactly that.

This post is a **technical breakdown** of how I built this site, the technologies I used, and the challenges I faced along the way.

---

## **üìå Tech Stack & Choices**
### **Astro: The Foundation**
I chose [Astro](https://astro.build) as the core framework for this site. Given my background in data engineering and automation, I wanted something lightweight and efficient‚Äîwithout unnecessary JavaScript bloat. Astro fit perfectly because:
- **Static-first**: Pages are mostly pre-rendered HTML, ensuring fast performance.
- **Component-driven**: Allows reuse of UI elements while keeping things simple.
- **Island architecture**: JavaScript is only used where needed, optimizing performance.

Astro‚Äôs ability to integrate with **React, Svelte, Vue, or just plain HTML** made it an ideal choice for a **content-heavy site that doesn‚Äôt need full SPA behavior**.

### **TailwindCSS: Styling Simplified**
Styling is handled using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com), which I love for its **utility-first approach**. Instead of managing complex CSS files, I can style components inline:
```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
  Click Me
</button>
```
This keeps styles **consistent, scalable, and easy to manage** across the site.

### **TypeScript: Strict Typing for Maintainability**
I used [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) to ensure type safety across the project. Even though Astro doesn‚Äôt require TypeScript, adding static types helps prevent runtime errors and improves editor autocompletion.

```ts
interface BlogPost {
  title: string;
  date: string;
  description: string;
  tags: string[];
}
```
This approach ensures that blog posts and other dynamic content are always properly structured.

### **GitHub Pages: Deployment with GitHub Actions**
The site is deployed via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), using **GitHub Actions** for continuous deployment. Initially, I set everything up on my own **DigitalOcean droplet** behind **NGINX**, as I‚Äôm a huge fan of self-hosting. However, the **convenience, reliability, and zero-maintenance nature** of GitHub Pages was too good to pass up.

The deployment workflow runs every time I push to `main`, automatically building and deploying the site. Here‚Äôs a simplified version of my **GitHub Actions workflow**:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install, Build, and Upload
        uses: withastro/action@v2

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: github-pages
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

With this setup, my site is automatically updated whenever I push a new change, making maintenance effortless.

## **üöÄ Key Features**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Privacy-Focused: No Trackers**
Many personal sites use analytics tools like Google Analytics, but I opted for **zero tracking**. Tools like [Blacklight](https://themarkup.org/blacklight?url=cblazer.co&location=us&device=mobile&force=false) confirm that **no user data is collected or stored**‚Äîkeeping this site lightweight and privacy-friendly.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Blazing Fast Performance**
Achieving a [Perfect 100 on Google PageSpeed](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-cblazer-co/hat01z94cw?form_factor=mobile) was a goal from the start. Astro‚Äôs static rendering, minimal JavaScript, and Tailwind‚Äôs optimized CSS all contribute to this.

Some key optimizations include:
- **Lazy-loading images** to reduce initial page load size.
- **Optimized fonts** via system defaults to avoid render-blocking.
- **No unnecessary client-side JavaScript**‚Äîonly used where interactivity is needed.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Built-in RSS Feed**
The site generates an **RSS feed** automatically so readers can subscribe to new posts. This is implemented using Astro‚Äôs [RSS integration](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/rss/).

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Light & Dark Mode**
User experience is important, so I implemented **theme toggling** with Tailwind‚Äôs dark mode support.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Commenting System with Giscus**
Instead of using Disqus (which tracks users), I integrated [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) for **GitHub-based comments**. This allows users to comment using their GitHub accounts, keeping the site free from third-party tracking.

## **üìÖ What‚Äôs Next?**
This site is just getting started. Upcoming plans include:
- **More blog posts** covering tech, data, and side projects.
- **Project case studies**‚Äîbreaking down things I‚Äôve built.
- **Potential integrations** (micro-interactions, experiments, etc.).

If you made it this far‚Äîthanks for reading! If you‚Äôre building your own site or have thoughts on this, feel free to reach out. üöÄ
