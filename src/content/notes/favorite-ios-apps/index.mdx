Flighty for tracking my flights. Useful for travel or keeping track of family and friends, especially when I'm the one picking them up from the airport. [Flighty](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flighty-live-flight-tracker/id1358823008)

Drafts for when you just want to write something down right now. No extra press to create a new note, just jot it down. [Drafts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1236254471)

Apollo for Reddit. When Reddit finally manages to fully pry Apollo from us, it might finally be time to say goodbye. The official Reddit app is simply unusable after being used to the bliss of Apollo. [Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apollosideloaded/)

Strong for tracking my workouts. Simple app that does everything I need it to doâ€”track my sets and reps and manage routines. Bought a lifetime membership years ago and have never used a different workout app. [Strong](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/strong-workout-tracker-gym-log/id464254577)

Octal for HackerNews. [Octal](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/octal-for-hacker-news/id1308885491)

Transit for public transit. [Transit](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/transit-subway-bus-times/id498151501)

Night Sky for identifying which star or planet you're looking at. [Night Sky](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/night-sky/id475772902)

Seek for identifying which plant you're looking at. [Seek](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/seek-by-inaturalist/id1353224144)

Tide Alert for checking the tides. I lived in Juneau, AK for 1.5 years and the tide shifts were huge, up to 20 ft. Growing up near San Francisco where the tidal shift is ~4 ft, this app helped me stay safe when hiking on the coast. [Tide Alert](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tide-alert-noaa-tide-chart/id1352211125)

Watch Duty for tracking fires. Never been more relevant for us Californians and always has up-to-date info. [Watch Duty](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/watch-duty-wildfire-maps/id1574452924)

JustWatch for finding which streaming service has what you're trying to watch. For some reason, Google is exceptionally terrible for this. [JustWatch](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/justwatch-movies-tv-shows/id979227482)

Gaia GPS for outdoor adventures. Alltrails is great and I love it, but for serious outdoor adventures in remote areas, you need Gaia. [Gaia GPS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gaia-gps-mobile-trail-maps/id1201979492)
